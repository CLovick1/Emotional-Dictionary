sensations and/or thoughts creates a deeper emotional
pull.

NOSTALGIA
DEFINITION: Fondly recalling a past period or situation one would
like to revisit
 
NOTES: While nostalgia and homesickness are often seen as the
same thing, there are subtle differences between the two. The former
is typically a fond remembering, while the latter is a deeper feeling
that’s often coupled with a strong sense of sadness or even grief. If
your character is feeling HOMESICK, see that entry for ideas on how
it might be expressed.
