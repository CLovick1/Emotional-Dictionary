Seeking a quick exit to avoid the scrutiny of others
Hands that tremble slightly
A sudden onset of clumsiness

WRITER’S TIP: Sometimes an unexpected emotion
creates a gateway to a revelation, showing the character a
deeper truth about a past event or offering them clarity in a
current one. Spend time describing these moments
because they often lead to growth and transformation.
