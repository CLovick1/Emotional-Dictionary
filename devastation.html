Asking someone to repeat the news out of utter disbelief 
Laying a splayed-out hand against one’s chest
Needing to sit or be supported
Covering one’s face with both hands and collapsing 
Stopping what one was doing mid-task
A pained expression, with eyes that cloud or focus inward
Brows that pull together and down 
A gape that widens
Slow shakes of the head that become wider and faster as the news sinks in
Not knowing where to look or what to do 
Expelling an audible breath
One’s chest caving, the spine curling forward
Using a hand to support one’s head or rub at the forehead
Being at a loss for words (speaking in fragmented sentences, starting and stopping, etc.)
Pressing a palm over one’s mouth and then letting it fall away or pull down
Arms that drag at one’s shoulders, with the limbs going loose
Sagging back into a chair
A voice that goes weak or cracks 
Eyes that ﬁll with tears
A shaking hand reaching to cover the mouth
Repeating negatives: <i>It just can’t be, or I don’t believe this is happening.</i>

Not responding to questions
Not knowing what to do with one’s hands

A heart that hurts
Feeling numb all over

<b>MENTAL RESPONSES</b> 
Being unable to believe what one is seeing (if one is experiencing the cause ﬁrsthand)
Imagining the event unfolding as it is described (if one is hearing the news secondhand)
Immediately remembering the last time one was in contact with the affected person, people group, or place
Thinking of the people most deeply affected and how they are taking the news
Sudden regret: <i>Why didn’t I visit more often? and I should have told her what she meant to me.</i>
Feeling relief, followed by guilt: <i>Thank goodness Joe stayed home, or he’d be dead too.</i>
Struggling with even the small things; feeling overwhelmed

<b>ACUTE OR LONG-TERM RESPONSES FOR THIS EMOTION</b> 
Being unable to eat, sleep, or engage in normal activities
Cutting the source of pain from one’s life (giving up a passion, quitting a job, etc.)
Progressing into grief but never moving past it
Becoming a hollowed-out version of oneself (lacking vitality, drive, or personality)
Emotional numbness that prevents connection with people or the world outside
Losing the will to live

<b>SIGNS THAT THIS EMOTION IS BEING SUPPRESSED</b> 
Withdrawing from the situation to be alone (ﬂight)
Saying nothing and retreating inside oneself 
Self-medicating to numb the emotional pain
A chin that quakes with one’s effort to keep in tears
Throwing oneself at a task (e.g., funeral arrangements) to avoid the pain of grief

<b>WRITER'S TIP:</b> Opening up about difﬁcult feelings signals an important breakthrough for a character on their journey of change. To be realistic, it won’t be easy; emotional pain is hard to face and harder to talk about. Show this stress and struggle using vocal cues and body language
