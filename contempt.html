<b>WRITER'S TIP:</b> When revising, look for instances where emotions are NAMED. Nine times out of ten, this indicates a lack of conﬁdence that the emotion is shown clearly through thought, sensations, and body language. Strong verbal and nonverbal cues negate the need to explain the emotion to the reader.
