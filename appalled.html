One’s posture straightening, the muscles visibly tightening 
Clasping a hand over one’s own mouth
Grabbing the fabric of one’s shirt in a ﬁst (at chest level)
Brieﬂy covering one’s mouth and then moving the hand to one’s breastbone
Putting a hand out as if to ward off what one has witnessed or was told
Swallowing before speaking
Asking <i>What?</i> sharply (if the shock resulted from something another said)
Saying <i>Oh my God, or Did you see what he did?</i> as one tries to process
One’s shoulders rolling forward as the chest caves, making the neck seem to shrink
Rubbing at the chest
Appearing to go white in the face
