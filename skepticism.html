WRITER’S TIP: Some emotions, like confusion, should be
shorter-lived or paired with another feeling. If the POV
character is disoriented for too long, readers may struggle
to follow what’s happening in the scene.

VULNERABILITY
DEFINITION: Having one’s guard lowered; feeling emotionally
exposed
 
NOTES: Vulnerability can be a positive, negative, or mixed
experience. A vulnerable person who feels fear may display
protective gestures while a hopeful person purposefully making
himself vulnerable may express more optimistic or open actions. It is
also common for a character to progress from protective to open
movements if he feels safe.
