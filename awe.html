    <h1>AWE</h1>
    <pre><b>DEFINITION</b> Euphoric-like wonder at being in the presence of something vast enough to change one’s perceptions or understanding of the world
<b>NOTES:</b> Awe can enlighten or terrify (based on whether the character can handle what they have experienced), since it often leaves a person feeling small and insigniﬁcant. For the negative emotional reaction, please see the HORROR entry.

<b>WRITER'S TIP:</b> When you’re describing a character’s emotional reaction through the eyes of another character, think about the depth of their relationship. If it’s close, a simple hair tuck or half-wave could be steeped in meaning which the point of view character can then share with the reader.
