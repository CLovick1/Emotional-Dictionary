    <h1>Self-Pity</h1>
    <pre>ASSOCIATED POWER VERBS: Berate, betray, blame, boil, bristle,
complain, disbelieve, dredge, fester, ﬂame, ﬂare, gall, glower, heat,
insult, irritate, jab, judge, mutter, point, poke, provoke, quarrel, resent,

WRITER’S TIP: With emotion, get personal. A tragic
situation like a news story about a lost child on TV will
affect everyone, but if the child is someone special to the
character who is watching, the effect is tenfold.
