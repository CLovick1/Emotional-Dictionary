ADD COMPLICATIONS FOR YOUR
CHARACTER WITH EMOTION AMPLIFIERS
 
Did you know there’s a companion to The Emotion Thesaurus?
 
While The Emotion Thesaurus was written to help authors convey
character emotions to readers, there are also ways to amplify what a
character is feeling, thereby heightening their responses. In Emotion
Ampliﬁers, a complementary ebooklet to The Emotion Thesaurus, we
explore common conditions that naturally galvanize emotion.
Exhaustion, boredom, illness, pain, extreme hunger, and the like can
push characters to their limits, compromising their decision-making
abilities and decreasing the likelihood of them reaching their goals.
 
Emotion Ampliﬁers is a great tool for any writer wishing to tighten the
screws on their characters and ramp up the tension in their stories.
For your convenience, we’ve provided the following list of the
ampliﬁers that can be found in this book, along with a sample entry.
