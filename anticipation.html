negative experience beyond one’s comprehension or imagining
 
PHYSICAL SIGNALS AND BEHAVIORS:

One’s mouth falling open, the upper lip curling back
Grimacing and wanting to look away but being unable to
The head recoiling from the source, eyes wide and staring
One’s words drying up mid-sentence
Opening the mouth to speak but being unable to ﬁnd words
Trying to make sense of what one is experiencing by reading other
people’s reactions
Speaking in fragments: This...He...Why...

Swallowing rapidly
Retreating; putting distance between oneself and the source
A slow intake of uneven breath (shuddery or shaky)

over one’s chest, etc.)

Stumbling back a step or two
Tripping and falling as one tries to create some distance
Pushing the back of the hand against one’s nose and looking away
Holding a shaking hand up between oneself and the source
Eyes that are unable to close
Cringing and rubbing one’s palm against the chest (above one’s
heart)
The body contorting (knees drawing up, the torso twisting, arms
pulling in, etc.)
Scraping one’s palms against clothing as if to rid them of something
Rubbing or pulling at the ears (if a sound is part of the experience)
Clapping the hands over the sides of one’s head to block out a
speciﬁc noise
Forcing oneself to look down or to the side, breaking eye contact
Taking a deep breath to try and regain control of one’s emotions
Trying to verbally diffuse the moment (reasoning, bargaining, or
placating) by talking slowly and enunciating one’s words
Moving slowly, using no sudden movements
Pulling loved ones close (gathering children, drawing a spouse near)
to protect them
 
INTERNAL SENSATIONS:
Internal chest pressure from forgetting to breathe
Body tension (e.g., the stomach hardening)
The burn of bile in the back of the throat
An uncontrollable shudder that sweeps through one’s entire body
A sudden drop in body temperature
A hard thudding in the chest from an increased heart rate
 
MENTAL RESPONSES:
Losing track of spatial awareness (fumbling, clumsiness, stumbling,
etc.)
Focusing on something small (like breathing) to feel more in control
Sudden revelations (putting together pieces of information that would
have foreshadowed the negative experience, if one had only realized
their signiﬁcance)
A hyper-focus on the possible dangers associated with this moment
(survival instinct)
 
ACUTE OR LONG-TERM RESPONSES FOR THIS EMOTION:
Breaths coming in short bursts once the initial shock passes
A loosening of the bladder
Shutting down and freezing on the spot
Uncontrolled tears sliding down one’s cheeks and onto trembling lips
Looking for an escape
Turning and ﬂeeing
A heart attack
 
SIGNS THAT THIS EMOTION IS BEING SUPPRESSED:
A hard, visible swallow as one’s lips press tight
A slight tremor in the ﬁngertips
A voice that warbles before it steadies
Adopting a strained smile that twitches as it widens, ﬁghting for mind
over body
Nervous laughter

ASSOCIATED POWER VERBS: Clench, conceal, convulse, cringe,
ﬂee, freeze, gag, gasp, grip, nauseate, quiver, recoil, reject, repress,
retreat, seize, shake, shrink, shudder, stare
 
WRITER’S TIP: Too much self-awareness can hurt
emotional descriptions. Rarely do people think about the
mechanics of what their bodies are doing (I felt my lungs
swell with unspent breath), so weigh description more on
showing a character’s reactions and behaviors naturally
as they happen.
