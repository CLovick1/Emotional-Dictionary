About the Authors
INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND EDITION
When we ﬁrst released The Emotion Thesaurus almost seven years
ago, it was with enormous trepidation. This was our ﬁrst nonﬁction
project, and what we didn’t know about self-publishing would have
ﬁlled its own book. What we did recognize was our own difﬁculty
conveying character emotion in a way that would engage readers.
This problem is a big one, because only when the character’s
emotions are clearly shared can readers become more involved. We
wanted to ensure that our character’s feelings would trigger the
reader’s own emotional memories, encouraging empathy that would
draw them deeper into the story. Based on a hunch that other writers
also had this problem, we set out to provide a solution with The
Emotion Thesaurus. It wasn’t clear just how common the problem
was until we saw the response to our book—a response that
continues to amaze and humble us.
Our hypothesis conﬁrmed, we dug deeper into this topic, and as we
expanded our own knowledge, it became clear that we had more to
share. Hence, our decision to release an updated edition of The
Emotion Thesaurus.
The instructional material in the ﬁrst part of the book continues to
offer its unique how-to cocktail of writing emotion and show-don’t-tell
tips but with some powerful new additions. It’s been expanded to
include a section on how dialogue can and should be used to convey
a character’s feelings. We’ve also explored the critical part subtext
plays in natural conversation and how it can be written to show
hidden emotion. And because backstory ﬁgures so heavily into
characterization, we’ve added information on what research should
be done to establish your character’s wounding events and emotional
range, which will allow you to write their responses realistically and
consistently.
As for the emotions themselves, we now have a total of 130 entries,
each of which contains a list of the physical cues, thoughts, and
internal sensations that, chosen thoughtfully, will enable you to create
the perfect responses for your character. We’ve added power verbs
so you can choose stronger words to describe associated actions,
and sets of escalating and de-escalating emotions to help you
visualize where a character might naturally go next.
In short, we hope you’ll ﬁnd the second edition of The Emotion
Thesaurus to be even more useful than its predecessor. Our goal, as
always, is to give you the methods and brainstorming tools that make
it easier to write emotional moments that are fresh and evocative.
THE POWER OF EMOTION
All successful novels, no matter what genre, have one thing in
common: emotion. It lies at the core of every character’s decision,
action, and word, all of which drive the story. Without emotion, a
character’s personal journey is pointless. Stakes cease to exist. The
plot line becomes a dry riverbed of meaningless events that no
reader will take time to read. Why? Because above all else, readers
pick up a book to have an emotional experience. They read to
connect with characters who provide entertainment and whose trials
may add meaning to their own life journeys.
As emotional beings, feelings propel us. They steer our choices,
determine who we spend time with, and dictate our values. Emotion
also fuels our communication, allowing us to share meaningful
information and beliefs with others. And while it may seem that most
exchanges happen through conversation, studies show that up to
93% of communication is nonverbal. Even in instances where we try
not to show our feelings, we are still sending messages through body
language and vocal cues. Because of this, each of us becomes adept
at reading others without a word being said.
As writers, we must take our innate skills of observation and
transfer them to the page. Readers have high expectations. They
don’t want to be told how a character feels; they want to experience
the emotion for themselves. To make this happen, we must ensure
that our characters express their feelings in ways that are both
recognizable and compelling to read. Thankfully, the media for
conveying emotion are customizable, so with a bit of elbow grease,
writers can craft original, authentic responses personalized to every
individual in the story.
 
VEHICLES FOR SHOWING EMOTION
Dialogue is what we use to articulate our ideas, thoughts, beliefs,
and needs, all of which are driven by our emotional state. What we
feel always propels us, but it is rare to refer to those feelings directly
in conversation. So while dialogue is a proven vehicle for sharing a
character’s emotions, it rarely should do so alone. To convey feelings
well, a writer should also utilize nonverbal communication, which can
be broken down into four additional vehicles: vocal cues, body
language, thoughts, and visceral reactions.
Vocal Cues are shifts in the voice that supply readers with valuable
hints about the speaker’s emotional state. In conversation, there isn’t
always time to think about how to react, so while a person might
disguise their true feelings by choosing their words carefully, their
tone of voice or the ﬂow of words won’t be as easy to control.
Hesitations, a voice that changes tone or pitch, words that suddenly
slide out faster—all of these are terriﬁc indicators that a character’s
emotions have changed and there’s more to the exchange than
meets the eye.
Vocal cues can be especially useful for showing the feelings of a
non-point-of-view character, since, in most written viewpoints, their
direct thoughts cannot be shared with the reader.
Body Language is how our bodies outwardly respond when we
experience emotion. The stronger the feeling, the more we react and
the less conscious control we have over movement. Because
characters are unique, they will express themselves in a speciﬁc way.
Combine the vast number of physical signals and behaviors found in
this book with the individuality of each character, and a writer’s
options for showing emotion through body language and action are
virtually limitless.
Thoughts act as a window into the mental process that
corresponds with an emotional experience. A character’s internal
monologue is not always rational and can skip from topic to topic with
incredible speed, but utilizing that mental response to express
emotion is a powerful way to convey how they see their world.
Thoughts also add a layer of meaning by illustrating how people,
places, and events affect the POV (point-of-view) character and can
help showcase their voice.
Visceral Reactions are the most powerful form of nonverbal
communication and should be used with the most caution. These
internal sensations (heart rate, light-headedness, adrenaline spikes,
etc.) are raw and uncontrolled, triggering the ﬁght-ﬂight-freeze
response. Because these are instinctive reactions, all people
experience them. As such, readers will recognize and connect with
them on a primal level.
The very nature of these heightened responses requires writers to
take special care when using them. Relying too much on internal
sensations can create melodrama. Also, because visceral reactions
are limited, a writer can inadvertently use clichéd phrasings when
describing them. A light touch is needed with this type of nonverbal
communication, as a little goes a long way.
CHARACTER RESEARCH: WHAT TO KNOW
TO WRITE AUTHENTIC EMOTION
In the real world, no two people are alike, which means each of us
expresses emotion in our own way. Some people ﬁnd it perfectly
natural to share what they feel with those around them, experiencing
little to no discomfort with their emotions being on display. Others ﬁnd
the idea of revealing what they feel horrifying and will avoid situations
that could lead to such vulnerability. Most fall somewhere between
these extremes. This spectrum of expressiveness is called an
emotional range, and it will inﬂuence not only which feelings a
person overtly shows but when and how they will manifest. While
each person tends to stick to a speciﬁc area of the spectrum overall,
situations where emotions are heightened can cause a shift one way
or the other.
Interestingly, while we are each unique in our expressiveness, this
individuality originates from the same place for everyone: our
collective pasts. Upbringing, education, experiences, beliefs, and
personality will all determine who we are and how we go about
showing our emotional selves to the world.
As writers, one of our biggest goals is to create characters who are
true-to-life, so we want to strive for this individuality when we consider
how they will express themselves. The best way to do this is to spend
time digging into each character’s backstory and uncover details that
will show us how to design their reactions.
Backstory planning often gets a bad rap, because some writers
dump that information into a scene as exposition, believing that
readers must know every detail to fully understand the forces at work
in the character’s life. The reality is that most backstory is for the
writer, not the reader. Like a GPS is helpful for navigating a new city,
understanding key details about a character’s life prior to the story’s
start makes it easier to write actions, choices, and decisions that will
align with who they are. Not only will this draw readers in through
active characterization, it also creates intimacy and puts the
character’s emotions directly on display through speciﬁc behaviors
and mental processes.
The amount of backstory planning each character requires will vary
depending on their role in the story, but since everyone is a product of
the past, there are two universal areas worth exploring: the
important people in your character’s life and the impactful
experiences that have stayed with them.
Because we’re social creatures, when it comes to navigating life,
we tend to look to others, especially those who are closest to us.
They help us form beliefs and values and teach us how to behave
and what to feel. Unfortunately, the people who have the most access
and inﬂuence are not always the most supportive or functional,
meaning not all our life lessons are positive ones. This is important to
remember when thinking about who from your character’s past
served as an example or inﬂuenced them. Speciﬁcally ask yourself:
Who shaped my character’s views on emotion, and did they pass on
functional or dysfunctional attitudes and behaviors?
For example, a character whose parent belittled her every time she
cried as a child learns an unspoken lesson: it is better to hide emotion
than share it openly. After being repeatedly invalidated in this way,
the character will most likely become evasive or even lie about what
they feel because they believe anything else will lead to ridicule and
judgment.
Likewise, people who serve as positive inﬂuences for your
character will convey healthy ideas about emotion. A character with
an older brother who vocalized his feelings and used them to
positively sway others will see that emotions are powerful and can
become a vehicle for change. Provided our character looked up to his
older sibling, he will likely adopt this same attitude and behave the
same way, understanding that other people will connect to him better
if he shows what he feels.
Just as important people in your character’s life helped shape how
they express emotion, certain experiences can also be formative.
Imagine a natural disaster, perhaps a ﬂood that destroys much of
your character’s neighborhood. In the aftermath, he’s utterly
devastated by the destruction of his home and feels powerless at
seeing the grief of his neighbors who have suffered a similar loss.
When TV crews show up, he can’t hold back what he feels, and he
breaks down on camera, which causes an outpouring of support from
the rest of the city. People come forward to bring food, offer everyone
a place to stay, help with clean up, and donate needed items. Not
only will this wave of compassion and empathy help alleviate the
character’s despair, it will instill the belief that sharing your feelings
results in getting what you need most. After this experience, it’s very
likely he will feel more comfortable displaying his emotions openly.
In addition to these two important backstory considerations, here
are other areas worth brainstorming so you can zero in on how to
show each character’s feelings.
 
BASELINE REACTIONS
To understand how a character might react to the big moments of
conﬂict and upheaval in the story, we need to establish a baseline of
how they behave in everyday situations. Take the typical “long line at
a grocery store checkout” scenario. In front of your character are six
people, including the current customer who not only has more than
the allotted ﬁfteen items, he’s constantly requesting price checks on
them. How will your character react? Will he wait quietly, hating the
slowness but knowing it would be futile to speak up? Or after a minute
of ﬁdgeting and fuming, will he drop his basket on the ﬂoor and shout
at the cashier to open more registers?
In the ﬁrst case, the character’s baseline becomes obvious: it will
take a lot more than a few wasted minutes to rile him up. But if the
second reaction is his default, we know that when life starts chucking
lemons at him, his rage cannon will ﬁre.
Establishing this baseline will help you maintain consistency
throughout the story. And if you want to push a character closer to
one end of their personal emotional range, you’ll know how hard the
screw should be turned. So imagine a few benign scenarios that
could be part of your character’s normal day—a car that won’t start,
being late for an appointment, waking up sick, or plans changing at
the last minute. It’s worth the effort to imagine your character in
situations like these to get a feel for how they will react.
 
DEMONSTRATIVE OR RESERVED
Another aspect to consider when determining emotional range is the
natural level of expressiveness for your character. Some people are
more reserved while others are demonstrative, and this preference
shapes the types of expression they’ll use.
Imagine a character learning that her adult children who have been
living abroad will be returning home for Christmas. A reserved
character may sit down to handle the surprise, a full smile brightening
her expression. Her voice could warble as she speaks or she might
reach out to her husband and give his hand a quick squeeze. A
demonstrative character would react with more vigor, jumping up to
crush her husband in a hug or making animated hand gestures as
she rattles off every thought in her mind surrounding the happy news.
Understanding your character’s tendencies will help you plan body
language and verbal cues accordingly.
 
COMFORT ZONES
Not everyone feels comfortable sharing emotion in all situations. Your
character’s expressiveness will likely shift depending on where they
are and who they’re with. In private, people generally don’t hold back,
but being around others can trigger a high degree of self-
consciousness. If they feel exposed or are worried about being
judged, they might rein in their emotions. However, if your character
is surrounded by people they trust or others experiencing the same
emotions, he or she will be more comfortable expressing their
feelings. As a rule, if the character believes it’s safe to show what
they feel, they typically will; if they don’t, they won’t. Plan your scenes
with this in mind.
Remember that the character’s comfort zone will also extend to
dialogue. Some people prefer to communicate more of what they feel
while others remain tight-lipped. Likewise, your character will be more
comfortable opening up to certain people, so let the nature of their
relationships dictate how much is shared in each conversation. For
ideas on how to convey hidden emotion through dialogue, see the
section on subtext.
 
STIMULUS VS. RESPONSE
Not all characters have the same interests, fears, or beliefs, so how
they feel in a given scenario will vary, eliciting different reactions.
Imagine a spider crawling across the table where three of your
characters are eating lunch. Carla is the ﬁrst to notice it meandering
through the wasteland of takeout wrappers and salt packets. She
sucks in a strangled gasp and jerks back, causing her chair legs to
shriek. The second to see it is Diane, who leans away and crosses
her arms. Finally, Therese spots the leggy creature. She smiles,
plucks a discarded straw wrapper off the table and nudges the spider
in a direction away from the group.
The same moment, the same stimulus…and three different
responses. This is the nature of emotion. Carla’s response is fear-
driven. Diane displays wariness, assessing the spider as a non-threat
while still protecting her personal space, clearly not wanting the
creature to come closer. Therese is not bothered at all and only
wants to send the spider on its way before one of her companions
(likely Carla) demands its execution.
When it comes to various circumstances, we can’t assume that
every character will have the same reaction or even feel the same
emotion. Life experiences and personality will ultimately decide how
your character responds to any given stimulus. It may complicate
things when members of the story’s cast view the same situation
through their own lens, but this incongruency can beneﬁt writers,
providing another great way to highlight the originality of emotion-
driven behavior.
 
EMOTIONAL SENSITIVITIES AND INSECURITIES
A ﬁnal way to ensure a unique emotional range for your character is
to understand what insecurities and sensitivities lurk within. Every
character will have soft spots: emotions that are avoided because
they are uncomfortable or generate insecurity. Whenever one of
these emotions crops up in a scene, your character will feel cornered,
causing an instinct response to kick in: Fight, ﬂee, or freeze.
These powerful, volatile reactions are an excellent way to show
your character’s deeper layers and can often offer readers clues
about an emotional wound—a painful event that your character
experienced but has never moved past. Like an anchor dragged
through life’s choppy waters, this old trauma creates relationship
friction and holds her back from happiness and achievement. If you’re
writing a change arc, the emotional wound can derail your character’s
life. It must be examined and overcome if she is to grow and change
into someone stronger who can handle the challenges standing
between her and the story goal.
To illustrate the power of emotional sensitivities and how they can
be used, consider this example:
 
After the ceremony, everyone mingled, their voices ﬁlling
the garden. Linda drew in the scent of magnolias from her
bouquet and then exhaled, casting out the last of her jitters.
The wedding had gone perfectly; the wind behaved, no
guest was short a chair, and no one in the bridal party had
tripped or suffered a wardrobe malfunction during their walk
down the grassy aisle. She could ﬁnally relax.
Sarah, the bride, stood in the middle of the lawn talking to
a few guests. Sunlight glowed against her cheekbones and
glinted off the scatter of crystals sewn into her dress and
veil, a truly beautiful bride. After all her friend had been
through these last years—losing her mother, the multiple
miscarriages—Sarah deserved this perfect day with Tom.
Linda checked on the photographers setting up near the
old oak and judged them close to ready. As maid of honor,
she needed to keep everyone on a timeline, so she went to
gather up the bride.
Before she could get there, Sarah bolted toward an older
woman wearing a matronly purple dress and enveloped her
in a hug. “Nana, you made it!”
Nana. The word knifed through Linda, jolting her to a stop.
“Silly girl. A delayed ﬂight couldn’t keep me from making it
to your special day.” She pulled back and cupped Sarah’s
cheeks. “Such a beauty.”
Sarah took her grandmother’s weathered hands in her
own. “I hope you know what it means to me, that you’re
here. You’ve always taken care of me, and—”
“I love you, girl. Always will. Enough for both your mother
and me.”
Linda’s eyes grew hot, a contrast to the cold weight
crushing her lungs. This moment, this beautiful moment,
was killing her.
“Oh gosh, Nana. Let me ﬁnd my maid of honor so I can
introduce you. She’s like a sister to me, and the only reason
I’m still sane.”
Linda darted behind a group of wedding guests. The buzz
of conversation drowned out Sarah calling her name, and
Linda quickened her pace, heading for the French doors that
would take her inside. The light was too bright, the rose
garden too ﬁlled with sweetness. She couldn’t breathe. She
also couldn’t tell her best friend that meeting her
grandmother would be the most painful thing she could ask
Linda to do.
 
It’s clear in this example that something traumatic happened in
Linda’s past that involved her grandmother. Whatever it was, the
stain of it is so great that watching her best friend share a loving,
supportive moment with her Nana is too painful to bear, and so she
ﬂees.
Not only does this situation shine a spotlight on Linda’s emotional
sensitivities, it also provides a window into her past in a very active,
non-dumpy way. Readers will now want to know more and keep
reading in hopes of discovering exactly what happened. They will
also root for Linda, hurting when she hurts, and wishing for her to ﬁnd
happiness so she can be freed from her difﬁcult past.
Once you’ve established your character’s sensitivities, you can use
them to write scenes that evoke powerful feelings. This is easily done
via the setting. Embedding triggers (like Sarah’s grandmother) to
awaken these insecurities or touch on a past wound allows you to
reveal the point-of-view character’s feelings. It also helps readers see
exactly what is causing the elevated reaction.
USING DIALOGUE TO WRITE EMOTION
Once you’ve ﬁgured out who your character is and how their
emotional responses are likely to manifest, you’re ready to start
writing. As was mentioned previously, communication happens both
verbally and nonverbally, so writers need to be adept at using both to
show a character’s emotional state. Let’s start with the former.
Dialogue is the primary way we communicate with others, using it
to share ideas and information. It’s also a big part of how we connect
with people. This desire for closer relationships is why we go for
coffee with friends, date our spouses, and nag at our kids to tell us
about their day: we want to strengthen our connections, and the
surest way of doing that is by sharing our feelings with each other.
This happens because displaying our emotions requires vulnerability
—peeling back the outer layers of shielding to reveal one’s fragile
heart—which almost always results in a deepening relationship.
One of the most natural ways to reveal your character’s emotions
is through their conversations with others. And it’s important to get
this element right, because readers are keenly aware of how these
verbal exchanges work in real life. If you want to write dialogue that
showcases your characters’ feelings and rings true for readers, keep
the following tips in mind.
 
UTILIZE PERSONALITY AND BACKSTORY
There’s a reason you did all that research discussed in the previous
section—because who your character is will determine how they
respond emotionally to their circumstances. As an example, consider
someone who must initiate a tricky conversation with their boss. How
the exchange goes will be largely determined by the character’s
personality. Here’s how it might look for someone who is timid or
uncertain:
 
Jason tapped on the doorframe. The battle-axe didn’t look
up, just kept slashing through numbers on her sales report.
“Um, Mrs. Swanson?”
No response.
He shifted his weight, wondering how to proceed. He
couldn’t mess this up. He couldn’t miss another of Kristina’s
games.
Jason shufﬂed half a step into her ofﬁce. “Um…about this
weekend? I know your email said I needed to work, but…
Well, I kind of already have plans—”
“Cancel them,” she said in a tone that was as forgiving as
her Sharpie.
When he didn’t answer, she looked up. His gaze dropped
to the rug.
 
This conversation makes sense for a character with Jason’s
personality. But if the character were conﬁdent and not afraid of
confrontation, it would go differently:
 
Dominic gave the door a rat-a-tat before opening it. “Hey,
Mrs. Swanson.”
Silence.
He cleared his throat, clenching his hand around the
doorknob. “I can’t work this weekend. I have plans.”
“Cancel them,” she said, not bothering to look up.
Heat shot through his insides, bringing him to his full
height. “You can’t make me work last minute.” His voice was
louder now, and he didn’t care. “I can stay late on Monday
but not this weekend. Best I can do.”
That got her attention. She gave him her patented glare,
and he glared right back. If she thought she could intimidate
him with a staring contest, she’d never met his twelve-year-
old.
 
Both characters begin this scenario with nervousness, but that
emotion manifests differently based on the character’s personality.
This is why it’s so important to do your background research
beforehand, so you’ll know your character’s tendencies and how
they’re likely to respond when a curveball comes.
 
COMBINE THE VERBAL AND NONVERBAL ELEMENTS
When we think of dialogue, we almost always equate it with speech.
But the truth is that dialogue consists of more than just the words
being spoken. Body language is another component that’s a part of
every exchange. Omitting it will result in unnatural dialogue that will
yank readers right out of the story. As an example, take a look at
Jason’s conversation with only the speech included:
 
“Um, Mrs. Swanson?”
“Um…about this weekend? I know your email said I
needed to work, but…Well, I kind of already have plans—”
“Cancel them.”
 
While this still conveys Jason’s nervousness, it says very little
about his personality, and it reads awkwardly because this isn’t how
dialogue works. People shift positions when they speak, move
around, and may even interact with objects as a way to focus. These
movements, important for underscoring emotion, can also
characterize, killing two birds with one stone and adding dimension to
the scene.
The small actions that occur within a conversation are referred to
as “beats” by Browne and King, authors of the excellent resource
Self-Editing for Fiction Writers. Beats serve many purposes, one of
which is to reveal how a character feels about the words they’re
saying. Jason’s beats (the tentative tap on the door, the shifting
weight and shufﬂing footsteps, his inability to hold her gaze) express
his nervousness loud and clear. Cumulatively, they accomplish a
secondary purpose by also revealing personality.
Vocal cues—changes in the voice and speech patterns—are also
in evidence when the character is feeling emotional. We see this in
Jason’s hesitations and Dominic’s volume getting louder.
So as you’re crafting a conversation, consider your character’s
words carefully, but also think about what the emotion might be doing
to their voice. And be sure to include beats that conﬁrm for the reader
what the character is feeling while also telling a little something about
who they are.
 
TAKE IT EASY ON THE TAGS
Since we’re talking about the words between the words, let’s touch
brieﬂy on dialogue tags. These are the attributions that let you know
who’s talking—he said, she muttered, they shouted, etc. There are a
lot of choices, and some of them do express emotion. Hissed words
express a clear feeling, as do those that are mumbled, yelled, or
sung. But after a while, these unusual tags begin to stand out and can
give your writing an overworked or melodramatic feel.
This doesn’t happen as much with the simple said, which is so
common as to be virtually invisible on the page. Unless you overdo it,
it can be used by all characters and won’t feel repetitive. As far as
expressive tags go, a good rule of thumb is to save them for
important scenes or moments of high emotion. Use them sparingly
and they’ll work for your story instead of against it.
Another thing to remember is that tags aren’t always necessary. If
you’re worried about readers being confused about who’s talking, you
can take care of this with well-written beats. Looking back at the
previous examples, though quite a few words are exchanged, there is
only one direct tag in each. But because of the associated beats, the
conversations are easy to follow.
 
USE VOCAL CUES TO SHOW CHANGES IN EMOTION
As was mentioned earlier, the voice itself is another tool that can be
used to show a character’s emotional state. It’s one of the ﬁrst things
to change when a strong feeling comes on, and initially, it’s very hard
to mask. If you can capture that brief moment when control of the
voice is lost, you can indicate clearly to the reader that an emotion is
in play. Consider doing so by experimenting with the following vocal
elements.
 
Pitch: Does the voice get high and shrill or go low and rumbly?
 
Volume: Does the character move from a moderated volume to
almost yelling? Does the voice drop to a near whisper? Is it clear that
they’re struggling to maintain a reasonable volume?
 
Tone: Does a clear tone turn breathy or husky when someone is
aroused? When the character is close to tears, does the voice
become brittle or cracked? Does it lose all expression and become
ﬂat when anger hits?
 
Speech Patterns: Does your verbose character suddenly clam up?
Does her timid, verbally stumbling counterpart start running at the
mouth? Does poor grammar appear in a well-educated character’s
dialogue? Does a stutter or lisp announce itself?
 
Word Choice: What words might slip into a character’s vernacular
when they’re feeling emotional that they wouldn’t normally use?
Profanity and slurs? Words and phrases from their ﬁrst language? Pat
clichés?
 
If you’ve established a baseline for your character’s normal speech
and vocal patterns, a change can clue readers in that there’s been an
emotional shift. A word of warning, though: many of these cues can
be used for multiple feelings. A trembling voice could indicate
sadness, fear, uncertainty, anger, or nervousness, and without more
information, the reader won’t know which one the character is
experiencing. For this reason, it’s important to pair vocal cues with
thoughts (if the point of view being used allows you to do so) or body
language. Providing the situational context will also clarify things for
readers.
 
MAKE YOUR DIALOGUE WORK HARDER
Conversations in real life are complex; while they’re mostly about
sharing or gaining knowledge, that’s seldom the sole purpose of an
exchange. Yet we often use dialogue in stories to do just that: reveal
information to either the reader or another character. This can result
in an info dump, with the author dropping a heavy load of backstory or
narrative in the middle of the action. Info dumps are discouraged
because they’re boring and they slow the pace, causing reader
interest to ﬂag.
This doesn’t mean that dialogue isn’t a good vehicle through which
to share information, because it is. That just shouldn’t be the only
purpose. To keep your verbal exchanges sharp and multi-
dimensional, ask yourself the following question: What do my
characters want from this conversation?
People have different reasons for communicating with each other.
Some do it to connect while others just want to be afﬁrmed (Wow,
Anne, that’s so insightful!). An overbearing person might seek control
by dominating verbal interactions with his peers. Someone else might
want to appear self-important by sharing juicy tidbits with their
neighbors. On and on it goes.
When you know your character’s goal in a conversation, you’ll have
a better idea of what they might do to achieve it: steering the
exchange in a certain direction, manipulating the other party, avoiding
topics, disengaging at a certain point, etc. This knowledge will give
you a better idea of how the conversation will go.
It’s also important to note that the participants may be looking for
different things. This can lead to inherent conﬂict, since opposing
goals will result in someone—possibly both characters—not getting
what they want. Imagine Character A initiating a conversation
because she’s romantically interested in Character B, while
Character B is responding because being friendly with Character A
will get him something he wants (esteem, business connections, an
alibi, etc.). Someone is going to be thwarted in this scenario—either
immediately or down the road—and frustrated desires typically result
in an inﬂux of emotion, which is always good for piquing reader
interest.
So, absolutely, use those verbal exchanges to reveal the
information you want to get across, but don’t do it in a vacuum. Keep
the conversation interesting by considering each character’s goal and
using that knowledge to infuse emotion into the exchange.
SUBTEXT: WHAT LIES BENEATH
Writing realistic and evocative dialogue isn’t easy. The mechanics
can be tricky, but ample resources exist to help, and with enough
practice, it can be mastered. But there’s another truth we need to
keep in mind if we’re going to write dialogue effectively, and that is
simply this: our communications with others are rarely
straightforward. On the surface, it may seem like we’re engaging in
some simple back-and-forth, but if you look deeper, our
conversations are, to some degree, carefully constructed. We
withhold information, hide our emotions, dance around what we really
mean, avoid certain topics, downplay shortcomings or emphasize
strengths—all of which lead to exchanges that aren’t totally honest.
Given this knowledge, if we write conversations between our
characters that are completely candid, they’re going to fall ﬂat
because that’s not the way people generally deal with each other.
Subtext is a huge part of dialogue, and it’s often tied in some way to
emotion, so we need to be able to include it in our characters’
interactions.
Simply deﬁned, subtext is the underlying meaning. In a
conversation, you have all the obvious things happening on the
surface—the words, the “acceptable” emotions on display. But then
there are all the hidden elements that the character isn’t comfortable
sharing: their true opinions, what they really want, what they’re afraid
of, and emotions that make them feel vulnerable. These underlying
elements are the subtext, and they’re important because the
character wants and is actively seeking (often on a subconscious
level) to keep them hidden. This results in seemingly contradictory
words and actions as the character tries to overtly convey something
that isn’t 100% true.
As an example, take a look at this exchange between a teenaged
daughter and her dad.
 
“So how’d the party go?”
Dionne plastered on a smile and buried herself in her
Instagram feed. “Great.”
“See, I knew you’d have a good time. Who was there?”
Her mouth went dry, but she didn’t dare swallow, not with
Dad watching her over his coffee mug. Despite the hour, his
eyes were bright and searching, twin spotlights carving
through the mocha-infused fog.
“The usual. Sarah, Allegra, Jordan.” She shrugged.
Nothing to see here. Move along.
“What about Trey? I ran into his mom at the ofﬁce
yesterday and she said he was going.”
“Um, yeah. I think he was there.” She scrolled quicker, the
images blurring by.
“He sounds like a good kid. Maybe we could have him and
his mom over for dinner.”
Her stomach lurched. “Oh, I don’t know.” Her phone
trembled and she abandoned it, sitting on her hands to keep
them still. “We don’t really hang with the same crowd.”
“Oh.” Dad grabbed an apple from the bowl before heading
out. “Well, think about it. Couldn’t hurt to branch out and get
to know some new people.”
Once his feet hit the stairs, Dionne blew out a shaky
breath. How could her dad be so smart at work and so
stupid about people?
 
Clearly, Dionne isn’t being honest with her dad. She’s conveying
that everything’s ﬁne, but under the surface, we see a different story:
something happened at the party, it involved a boy she’s now
avoiding, and she doesn’t want her father to know about it. While Dad
is kept in the dark, the reader becomes privy to Dionne’s true
emotions: nervousness, fear, and possibly guilt.
This is the beauty of subtext in dialogue. It allows the character to
carry on whatever subterfuge she deems necessary with others while
revealing her true emotions and motivations to the reader. It’s also a
great way to naturally add tension and conﬂict. Without the subtext,
this scene is fairly boring, just two people having a morning chat. With
it, we can almost see the story playing out, with Dionne desperately
trying to keep her secrets while it becomes increasingly difﬁcult—
maybe even unhealthy—to do so.
So how do we include subtext in our characters’ conversations
without confusing the reader? Ironically, it’s fairly straightforward. It
just requires combining the vehicles for showing emotion that were
shared earlier—dialogue, vocal cues, body language, thoughts, and
visceral reactions. To see them in action, let’s take a closer look at
how they were used with Dionne.
First, we have her dialogue, which is unreliable; to some degree,
we all go a little Pinocchio when we start talking, and Dionne is no
exception. Her words subtly scream status quo: nothing happened at
the party and she doesn’t feel anything in particular. But her body
language (the plastered-on smile, frantic social media scrolling,
trembling hands) and visceral reactions (dry mouth, lurching
stomach) tell a different story. Her thoughts are also purely honest;
being private, this is how thoughts work.
The nonverbal vehicles are like annoying little brothers and sisters,
tattling on the dialogue and revealing true emotion. When you put
them all together, they ﬁll out the character’s narrative and paint a
complete picture for readers to see.
 
OTHER TECHNIQUES TO SHOW HIDDEN EMOTION
 
Over- and Underreactions
When you’ve done the background work on a character, you know
how they’ll react to ordinary stimuli and will be able to write reliable
responses. Readers become familiar with the character’s emotional
range and have an idea what to expect. So when the character
responds to a situation in an unexpected way, it sends up an alert for
readers that says, “Pay attention! This is important.”
Sometimes this occurs with an overreaction; a seemingly normal
situation comes along and the character freaks out. Not only does
this tell the reader that something unusual is going on, it also creates
an opportunity for the character to ﬂy off the handle and cause more
problems, worsening their situation.
Underreactions are more subdued and so contribute less ancillary
conﬂict, but they are just as effective at revealing hidden emotion.
Imagine a situation the reader knows should stun or disturb the
character, but when it happens, they get…nothing, or an obviously
controlled reaction. A downplayed response shows just as clearly that
the character is afraid to show their true feelings and so can be a
good way to hint at undisclosed emotion.
Every story should include these scenarios that set the character
off and cause them to react in unusual ways. Most of the time, the
triggers will be tied to their backstory. The research you conducted on
their wounds and sensitivities can provide you with speciﬁc situations
or people that can be used to provoke the character in the story.
 
Tics and Tells
No matter how adept a character is at hiding their feelings, they all
have their own tells—subtle and unintentional mannerisms that hint
at deception. As the author, you should know your characters
intimately. Take a close look at them and ﬁgure out what might
happen with their body when they’re being dishonest.
It could be a physical signal or behavior, such as covering the
mouth, spinning a wedding ring, or biting the lip. Maybe it’s one of the
vocal cues discussed earlier. It might be a true tic, like a muscle
twitch or excessive blinking. Figure out what makes sense for your
character, then employ that tell when they’re hiding something.
Readers will pick up on it and realize that, when it’s in play, everything
is not as it seems.
 
Fight, Flight, or Freeze Responses
In the most general sense, the ﬁght-ﬂight-freeze response is the
body’s physiological reaction to a real or perceived threat. We see
this in everyday interactions: when a person invades someone’s
space, stops what they’re doing mid-action, or literally ﬂees the
scene. It also happens on a smaller scale in our conversations.
Remember that every character has an underlying purpose for
engaging with others. When that purpose is threatened or the
character feels unsafe, the ﬁght-ﬂight-freeze reﬂex kicks in. You can
utilize this to great effect if you know which response your character
tends toward.
Fight responses are confrontational in nature and may include the
character turning toward an opponent to face them directly, squaring
up her body to make herself look bigger, or insulting the person to put
them on the offensive. Characters who lean toward ﬂight will have
reactions centering around escape: changing the subject,
disengaging from a conversation, stepping back to take oneself out of
the group, or fabricating a reason to leave. If the character’s fear or
anxiety is triggered, they may simply freeze up, losing their ability to
process the situation or ﬁnd the words they need and being unable to
act until something external happens to free them.
When characters exhibit a ﬁght-ﬂight-freeze response in
conversation, even if their emotions aren’t obvious, the reader will
recognize that they’re feeling threatened. This not only builds
empathy on the character’s behalf, it may also create intrigue as the
reader pays closer attention to ﬁgure out why they’re responding this
way.
 
Passive-Aggressive Reactions
Passive aggression is a covert way of expressing anger. If a
character is angry but doesn’t feel comfortable showing it, they’ll
often default to certain techniques that will allow them to get back at
the person without revealing how they really feel. By employing
sarcasm, framing insults as jokes, giving backhanding compliments,
and not saying what they really mean (We’re good, or I’ll get right on
that), characters are able to express their feelings in an underhanded
way that others may not recognize or know how to deal with.
This can be a tricky technique to use, because, by deﬁnition,
passive aggression masks the truth. But you can reveal it through a
character’s thoughts, the physical signals they exhibit in private
(particularly just after an interaction), and the cues they express when
the other person isn’t looking.
ADDITIONAL IDEAS FOR  
BRAINSTORMING FRESH EMOTION
With so many aspects to juggle, describing emotion in an evocative
way can be a challenge. It’s hard work to write something fresh-yet-
familiar that puts readers into the character’s emotional shoes so they
can share the moment. Our thesaurus entries will help you
brainstorm emotional expressions that can be transformed into
unique descriptions beﬁtting your character, but if you need ideas to
supplement that information, try one of the following techniques.
 
MINE YOUR MEMORIES
Sit back from the keyboard for a minute and think about what emotion
your character is feeling. There may be several, but one will be the
root cause of the others. When you identify it, think about a time when
you experienced this same emotion. Then, if you’re comfortable
doing so, recreate that moment in your mind and allow your body to
respond to the memory. For example, let’s pretend that we’re dealing
with guilt. What do you notice about your body—is there a faint, sour
taste in your mouth? Is your stomach bunching up? Does your throat
feel painful or constricted?
If it helps, get up and wander around. Pay attention to how your
body moves in this instance of remembered guilt: are your arms
curled around your torso or is your posture slumped? Are your eyes
closed or open? Do you feel itchy, tingly, or uncomfortable?
Don’t forget to pay attention to your thoughts; they can create a
window for readers to look through and see exactly what your
character is feeling and what’s causing their reactions. Are you
ﬁxating on the people involved, perhaps someone you let down? Are
you thinking about how awful it would be if others knew your secret?
In fact, what would you do if someone came into the room right now
and asked you about this situation?
Keep mining, paying attention to all aspects of yourself, inside and
out, until you ﬁnd an expression or response that would work well for
your character. Then write it in an original way that ﬁts their
personality and emotional range.
 
PEOPLE WATCH
While you don’t want to be labeled as creepy, watching people can
yield great ideas for body language (and dialogue, if you happen to
overhear their conversation). Look for everyday opportunities: waiting
for your bill to arrive at a restaurant, shopping at a store, standing at a
counter while a barista makes your coffee. Be respectful, but don’t
shy away from locations that could provide high emotion, because
people who are visibly upset, excited, or frustrated are treasure
troves of unique body movements.
If you do manage to overhear a conversation, pay special attention
to vocal cues and speech patterns. Challenge yourself to spot pitch
shifts, hesitations, throat-clearings, and other clues that are masking
hidden emotions or are alluding to the speaker’s true intentions.
 
TAKE NOTES DURING SCREEN TIME
Another terriﬁc way to observe how people express a range of
emotions is to pay attention to TV shows and movies. Unless they’re
purposely breaking the fourth wall, actors won’t have the beneﬁt of
sharing an internal monologue with the audience. This means they
must show what they feel through action and dialogue. Keep a pen
and pad handy and jot down any well-expressed cues you might want
to fold into your own storytelling.
If you aren’t much of a moviegoer, you can also take notes as you
read, paying attention to how other authors describe body language,
expressions, vocal cues, internal sensations, and thoughts. While you
should never reuse them verbatim in your own work, tracking strong,
evocative description is a good way to recognize skillful showing and
will give you a better idea of how to do the same but in your own way.
COMMON PROBLEMS WITH WRITING
NONVERBAL EMOTION
It should be clear by now that both verbal and nonverbal
communication are necessary and can be used in tandem to convey
character emotion. We’ve discussed the verbal component at length.
Now let’s look at some of the common traps associated with
nonverbal emotion and how to bypass them.
 
TELLING
By deﬁnition, nonverbal emotion can’t be told. It has to be shown.
This makes it difﬁcult to write because telling is easier than showing.
Here’s an example:
 
Mr. Paxton’s eyes were sad as he gave her the news. “I’m
sorry, JoAnne, but your position with the company is no
longer necessary.”
Instantly, JoAnne was angrier than she’d ever been in her
life.
 
This exchange is fairly easy to write—but not so easy to read.
Readers are smart and can ﬁgure things out for themselves. They
don’t want to have the scene explained to them, which is what
happens when a writer tells how a character feels. Another problem
with telling is that it creates distance between the reader and your
characters, which is rarely a good idea. In the preceding example, the
reader sees that Mr. Paxton is reluctant to give JoAnne the bad news
and that JoAnne is angry about it. But you don’t want the reader to
only see what’s happening; you want them to feel the emotion and
experience it along with the character. To accomplish this, writers
need to show the character’s physical and internal responses rather
than stating the emotion outright.
 
JoAnne sat on the chair’s edge, spine straight as a new
pencil, and stared into Mr. Paxton’s face. Sixteen years
she’d given him—days she was sick, days the kids were
sick—making the trip back and forth across town on that
sweaty bus. Now he wouldn’t even look at her, just kept
ﬁddling with her folder and rearranging the fancy
knickknacks on his desk. Maybe he didn’t want to give her
the news, but she wasn’t gonna make it easy for him.
The vinyl of her purse crackled and she lightened her grip
on it. Her picture of the kids was in there and she didn’t want
it creased.
Mr. Paxton cleared his throat for the hundredth time.
“JoAnne…Mrs. Benson…it appears that your position with
the company is no longer—”
JoAnne jerked to her feet, sending her chair ﬂying over
the tile. It hit the wall with a satisfying bang as she stormed
out of the ofﬁce.
 
This scene gives the reader a much better opportunity to share in
JoAnne’s anger. Through the use thoughts, of sensory details, a well
chosen simile, speciﬁc verbs, and body cues that correspond with the
featured emotion, readers can see that JoAnne is angry, but they also
feel it—in the straightness of her spine and the cheap vinyl in her grip,
in the force it takes to send a chair ﬂying across the room simply from
the act of standing.
An example like this also reveals a lot about the character. JoAnne
is not well-to-do. She has children to support. She may be angry, but
she’s also strong minded, family-oriented, and proud. This
information rounds out JoAnne’s character and makes her more
relatable to the reader.
Showing takes more work than telling, as word count alone will
indicate, but it pays off by drawing the reader closer to the character
and helping to create empathy. Once in a great while, it’s acceptable
to tell the reader what the character is feeling: when you have to pass
on information quickly, or when you need a crisp sentence to convey
a shift in mood or attention. But the other ninety-nine times out of a
hundred, put in the extra work and you will reap the beneﬁts of
showing.
 
CLICHÉD EMOTIONS
 
The grin that stretches from ear to ear
A single tear pooling in the eye before coursing down the cheek
Quivering knees that knock together
 
Clichés in literature are viliﬁed for good reason. They’re a sign of
lazy writing, a result of settling on the easy phrase because coming
up with something new is too hard. Writers often fall back on clichés
because, technically, these tired examples work. That grin implies
happiness as certainly as knee knocking indicates fear.
Unfortunately, phrases like these lack depth because they don’t allow
for a range of emotions. The single tear tells you that the person is
sad, but how upset is she? Sad enough to sob? Shriek? Collapse?
Will she even be crying ﬁve minutes from now? To relate to your
character, the reader needs to know the depth of emotion being
experienced.
When writing a certain emotion, remember to think about your body
and what happens to it when you’re feeling that way. For any given
emotion, there are literally dozens of internal and external changes
that, when referenced, will show the reader what your character is
feeling. The lists in this thesaurus are great for providing ideas, but
your own observations are just as helpful.
Secondly, know your character. Individuals do things differently—
even mundane activities like brushing their teeth, driving, or making
dinner. Emotions are no exception. Not every character will shout and
throw things when angry. Some speak in quiet voices. Others go
completely silent. Many, for various reasons, will cover their anger
and act like they’re not upset at all. Whatever your character is
feeling, describe the emotion in a way that is speciﬁc to him or her,
and you’re almost guaranteed to write something new and evocative.
 
MELODRAMA
If all emotions were of average intensity, they’d be easier to describe.
But emotions vary in strength. Take fear, for instance. Depending
upon the severity of the situation, a person might feel anything from
unease to anxiety to paranoia or terror. Extreme emotions will require
extreme descriptors, while others are relatively subtle and must be
described as such. Unfortunately, many writers make the mistake of
assuming that to be gripping, emotion must be dramatic. Sad people
should burst into tears. Joyful characters must express their glee by
jumping up and down. This kind of writing results in melodrama,
which leads to a sense of disbelief in the reader because, in real life,
emotion isn’t always so demonstrative.
To avoid melodrama, recognize that emotions run along a
continuum, from mild to extreme. For each situation, know where
your character is on that continuum and choose appropriate
descriptors. Just as extreme emotions call for extreme indicators,
temperate emotions should be expressed subtly. The indicators for
intermediate emotions will lie somewhere in the middle.
It’s also very important that your character follows a smooth
emotional arc. Consider the following example:
 
Mack tapped his thumb against the steering wheel, one
arm dangling out the window. He smiled at Dana but she
just sat there, twisting that one loop of hair around her
ﬁnger.
“Worried about your interview?” he asked.
“A little. It’s a great opportunity but the timing’s awful.
There’s too much going on.” She sighed. “I’ve been thinking
about cutting back. Simplifying.”
“Good idea.” He nodded along with the radio and waved
at the biker thundering past on his Harley.
“I’m glad you agree.” She faced him. “I think we should
break up.”
His foot slipped off the gas pedal. The air grew heavy,
making it hard to breathe. The car veered toward the middle
line and he let it drift, not caring whether he lived or died.
 
Unless Mack has a psychological reason for doing so, he shouldn’t
jump from placidity to depression in a matter of seconds. A realistic
progression would be to move from contentment to shock, then
disbelief, and ﬁnally to grief. Done thoughtfully, this emotional arc can
be shown with relatively few words:
 
“I’m glad you agree.” She faced him. “I think we should
break up.”
His foot slipped off the gas pedal. “What are you talking
about?”
“Mack. We’ve been headed this way for awhile, you know
that.”
He gripped the steering wheel and took deep breaths.
Sure, things had been rough lately, and she kept talking
about needing some time to herself, but she always came
around. And she’d deﬁnitely never uttered the words break
up.
“Look, Dana—”
“Please, don’t. You can’t talk me out of it this time.” She
stared at the dashboard. “I’m sorry.”
His insides twisted. He darted a look at her, but she was
curled against the door now, both hands resting easy in her
lap.
They were totally breaking up.
 
Make sure that your character’s feelings progress realistically. Map
out the emotional journey within the scene to avoid elevated
emotional responses that don’t make sense.
All of this is not to say that real life doesn’t produce extreme
emotion. Birth, death, loss, change—some situations call for intense
responses that may go on for awhile. Many writers, in an admirable
attempt to maintain believability, try to recreate these events in real
time. This results in long paragraphs or even pages of high emotion
and, inevitably, melodrama. Though real life can sustain this kind of
intensity for long periods of time, it’s nearly impossible for the written
word to do so in a way that readers will accept.
In these situations, avoid melodrama by abbreviating. This method
is often used for other real-life scenarios—conversations, for
instance. Small talk is left out to keep the pace moving forward.
Mundane tasks are also cut short, because the reader doesn’t need
(or want) to see the entire car washed, a piece at a time, while Bob
ponders a problem at work. In the same way, extensive emotional
scenes should be long enough to convey the appropriate information,
but not so long that you lose the audience. Write the emotion well,
develop empathy in your reader, maximize the words that you do use,
but don’t overstay your welcome.
 
OVER-RELIANCE ON BODY LANGUAGE
It can’t be overstated: body language is incredibly important for
showing the character’s emotion to readers. Without it, conversations
will read as stilted and unnatural, and for readers to ﬁgure out a
character’s emotional state, they’ll have to rely solely on the words
being spoken—which we know aren’t always reliable.
As in so many areas of writing, context is king, and the conveying
of emotion is no exception. Without the proper context, readers can’t
be sure which emotion the character is feeling. Are the ﬁdgety ﬁngers
a sign of excitement, nervousness, unease, or impatience? Even if it’s
combined with an elevated heartbeat, that doesn’t narrow the ﬁeld.
The missing piece that the reader needs is the why: Why is the
character exhibiting these behaviors? Proper context answers this
question, and it’s often provided through the character’s thoughts and
dialogue.
When a person is gripped by a strong emotion, they don’t tend to
think in terms of that feeling. An excited person doesn’t think to
himself, I’m so excited! because he already knows it. Instead, he
thinks about the cause of the excitement—perhaps by mentally
counting down the days to a loved one’s visit or summarizing a recent
phone call from a college admissions ofﬁce.
Physical reactions show what emotion is present, and the thoughts
show why it’s there. Both must be included for it all to make sense.
 
OVER-RELIANCE ON DIALOGUE OR THOUGHTS
Because nonverbal writing is harder to master, it makes sense that
some writers shy away from it, choosing to rely more on thoughts or
dialogue to express what a character is feeling. But an over-reliance
on either leads to problems.
 
“Are—Are you sure?” I asked.
“Without a doubt,” Mr. Baker replied. “It was neck-and-
neck right up to the end, but you came out ahead.
Congratulations, William!”
“I can’t believe it,” I said. “Valedictorian! I’m so happy!”
 
Word choice is important in expressing emotion, but it will only go
so far. After that, the writer is reduced to weak techniques like telling
the reader what’s being felt (I’m so happy) and over-using
exclamation points to show intensity. Without any action to break up
the dialogue, the conversation also sounds stilted.
On the other hand, conveying emotion solely through thoughts has
its problems, too.
 
My pulse was pounding somewhere in the 160 range. I did
it! Valedictorian! I was sure Nathan would come out ahead
—he was a phenom in the physics lab, and he’d been a
ghost at school all month, practically living in the library.
I threw my arms around Mr. Baker. I’d think about this
later and cringe with embarrassment, but right now, I didn’t
care. I’d done it! Take THAT, Nathan Shusterman!
 
Technically, there’s nothing wrong with this sample. Bodily cues,
both internal and external, are included. It’s clear to the reader that
William is excited. Yet it doesn’t ring true. Why? Because this
monologue screams for verbal interaction with others. Mr. Baker is
there and has clearly been talking to William. For William to be so
incredibly excited and not say anything comes across as...odd.
Internal dialogue is an important part of any story. There are many
scenes and scenarios where a paragraph or more of contemplation is
appropriate. This isn’t one of them. For this scene, and for the
majority of scenes, emotion is much more effectively conveyed
through a mixture of dialogue, thoughts, vocal cues, and body
language.
 
My pulse jittered somewhere around the 160 mark. No, I’d
heard him wrong, been tricked by an over-active, sleep-
deprived, twisted imagination.
“Are—” I cleared my throat. “Are you sure?”
“It was neck-and-neck right up to the end, but you came
out ahead. Congratulations, William.”
The leather chair squeaked as I collapsed into it.
Valedictorian. How’d I beat out Nathan, who’d been a ghost
all month, practically living in the library? Not to mention that
A- I scraped in physics.
“But I did it,” I whispered.
Mr. Baker stood to shake my hand. I jumped up and threw
my arms around him, lifting him off the ﬂoor. Later, I’d
remember this and die of embarrassment, but right now I
didn’t care.
“I did it. Take THAT, Nathan Shusterman!”
“Knew you had it in you,” he said in a strangled voice.
 
When expressing emotion, vary your vehicles, using both verbal
and nonverbal techniques for maximum impact.
 
MISUSING BACKSTORY TO ENHANCE READER EMPATHY
Every character is unique, inﬂuenced largely by events from the past.
One sureﬁre way to gain reader empathy is to reveal why a character
is the way he is. Take the movie Jaws, for example. The ﬁrst glimpse
we have of shark hunter Quint, he’s raking his none-too-clean
ﬁngernails down a chalkboard. Hardly endearing. As the movie
progresses, the viewer’s dislike is justiﬁed through his crass manners
and bullying of young Mr. Hooper. But once he tells his story of the
sinking of the Indianapolis and his many days and nights treading
water with the sharks, the viewer understands how he became so
hardened. His behavior hasn’t changed and we still don’t like him
very much, but we empathize with him now. We wish him better than
what life has served up to him.
This is just one example of the importance of backstory in building
reader empathy. People are products of their past. As the author, it’s
important for you to know why your characters are the way they are
and to pass that information along to readers. For more help on
developing your character’s backstory and discovering his resulting
personality, we recommend checking out the other books in our
thesaurus series.
The difﬁculty comes in knowing how much of the past to share.
Many writers, in an attempt to gain reader empathy, reveal too much.
Excessive backstory slows the pace and can bore readers, tempting
them to skip ahead to the good stuff. Undoubtedly, Quint’s path to
crusty and crazy contained more than that one unfortunate event, but
the rest didn’t need to be shared. That one story, artfully told, was
enough.
In order to avoid using too much backstory, determine which
details from your character’s past are necessary to share. Dole them
out through the context of the present-time story to keep the pace
moving. For inspiration, consider your favorite literary characters,
even those who may have been unlikable. Revisit their stories to see
what clues from the past the author chose to reveal, and how it was
done.
Backstory is tricky to write well. As is true of so many areas of
writing, balance is the key.
USING THE EMOTION THESAURUS
We’ve established that emotion powers a scene and, when written
well, propels readers out of apathy and into the character’s emotional
experience. Writing authentic emotion is not always easy, but to
create breakout ﬁction, writers must come up with fresh ideas to
express their characters’ feelings.
Emotion is strongest when both verbal and nonverbal
communication are used in tandem. The Emotion Thesaurus can
supply that critical nonverbal element writers need to ﬁre up an
emotional hit that will leave a lasting impression on readers. Here are
some ﬁnal ideas on how to use this book to its fullest:
 
IDENTIFY THE ROOT EMOTION
Certain situations can arouse a single, easily identiﬁable emotion. But
more often than not, human beings feel more than one thing at a
time. If you are struggling with how to convey this conﬂict to the
reader, take a step back and identify the root emotion. This is the
catalyst that dictates any other feelings your character might also
experience. Once you’ve found the root emotion, look to the
corresponding thesaurus entry for a range of suggestions. The May
Escalate To ﬁeld can also provide a logical progression for where
your character’s feelings might be headed. Once you’ve clearly
shown the root emotion, you can layer in other emotions to a lesser
degree and map out the full experience. Similarly, if the situation
shifts or is heading toward a resolution of sorts, you can source the
May De-Escalate To ﬁeld to see what emotions might come next.
 
UTILIZE THE SETTING
If you’re looking to add natural emotion in a scene, the setting may
provide the answer. Many writers don’t put much thought into where
their scenes take place, believing that any number of locations could
be used to equal effect. But this is shortsighted. Why not include a
setting that already contains inherent emotion for the character—
maybe one that is painfully rooted in the past? Doing so can set them
up for disappointment, trigger old wounds, or put their feelings on
edge and increase their chances of doing something foolish—all of
which can serve your story well.
Settings can also be used on a micro-level. Instead of the location
itself holding signiﬁcance, perhaps the items and people within it do.
Or maybe it contains the props you need to highlight a character’s
emotional state. Someone in the kitchen might sweep a wine glass off
the counter in a ﬁt of rage. An ofﬁce setting could also work, though
the same anger may require some control, ranging from a slammed
ofﬁce door to tense posture and ﬁngers pounding the keyboard.
When referring to the entries in this thesaurus, a writer should keep in
mind the character’s setting in order to create organic and unique
emotional responses.
 
LESS IS MORE
Using too many cues to describe a character’s feelings can slow the
pace and dilute the reader’s emotional experience. Sometimes this
happens when a writer fails to identify and focus ﬁrst on the root
emotion. Other times, it’s the result of choosing too many weak
descriptors. Strong imagery will paint an immediate picture, so
always strive to create concrete body language and vocal cues for
the reader to interpret. Watch for overlong emotional passages that
slow the action. Always think like a reader, and keep those pages
turning.
 
TWIST THE CLICHÉ
Whenever possible, writers should use fresh ideas to convey
emotion. But let’s face it...some descriptors work well. That’s why they
crop up in novels again and again. Each thesaurus entry includes a
myriad of possible cues; if you ﬁnd yourself leaning toward a
traditional response like eye rolling or ﬁst clenching that can be seen
as cliché, twist it ﬁrst.
Take shivering, for example—a common visceral indicator to imply
fear or discomfort. Shivers run up the spine, down the spine...these
are tired phrases that can turn off readers. Sure, the sensation ﬁts,
but why not come up with something new? Why couldn’t a shiver
swarm over the back of the legs? How about using a simile that likens
a shiver to leaf-cutter ants marching along a vine? Better yet, don’t
call it a shiver at all. Instead, describe the sensations of tightening
skin or hair being raised. Never be afraid to experiment. There are
many ways to take an old expression and twist it into something
unique.
 
VIEW ENTRIES AS A LAUNCHING POINT
Body movement, actions, visceral sensations, and thoughts are as
individual as the characters experiencing them. The list
accompanying each thesaurus entry is not designed as a one-size-
ﬁts-all set of options. It is meant, rather, to prompt writers to think
about the many possible behavioral beats at their disposal so they
can choose the most suitable options and transform them into an
evocative and unique emotional description.
Each character comes from a different background and has a
unique personality, meaning some options in the entries will be a
good ﬁt while others will not. Their comfort level around others will
also inﬂuence how they express emotion. With this in mind, entries
should serve as a brainstorming tool and encourage writers to take
the next step and create fresh, individual ways to show a character’s
emotional state.
 
TRY RELATED EMOTIONS
If you’re struggling to ﬁnd the perfect physical response, visceral
reaction, or thought, try reading through the entries of similar
emotions. Each entry contains different cues. Studying the lists for
related feelings may spark an idea for something new.
 
ADD AN AMPLIFIER
Getting your character into the right emotional state isn’t necessarily
easy because they don’t always go willingly. When they need an
extra push, consider adding an ampliﬁer. Emotion ampliﬁers are
states that stimulate emotion and make a character more volatile.
Hunger, boredom, pain, illness, etc. will deplete a character’s
emotional reserves and ramp up the stress, putting them on edge and
impacting their decision-making abilities. Keep possibilities like these
in mind when you need to drive your character’s emotions.
 
VISCERAL REACTIONS AS PHYSICAL INDICATORS
Sometimes, the strongest emotional responses are instinctive
(visceral) ones that occur mostly internally and are therefore difﬁcult
for others to notice. This becomes a problem for writers who want to
show a character’s emotion while remaining true to their third- or ﬁrst-
person point of view. In these cases, writers should focus on visceral
reactions that have a physical “tell” attached to them. For example,
sweating, blushing and shakiness have an external component that
can be seen by others. Utilizing these cues allows a writer to describe
a visceral reaction without damaging the integrity of the point of view.
Because of the external signs that accompany these unique internal
sensations, we have included them in the Physical Signals and
Behaviors ﬁeld.
 
A FINAL WORD
We created this book to help writers brainstorm stronger expressions
of their characters’ emotions, and we urge you to remember that
these entries are meant to be a starting point, not a cut-and-paste
tool. Using the book as such would only lead to boring, one-note
writing, and your story deserves to shine! While writing compelling
descriptions always takes more work (since it requires us to dig
deeper), it’s worth the effort, and your readers will thank you for it.
We hope The Emotion Thesaurus will become a useful companion
on your writing journey, traveling with you from one book to the next.
Happy writing!
