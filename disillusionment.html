    <h1>DISILLUSIONMENT</h1>
    <pre><b>DEFINITION</b> Hurt and disappointment upon discovering that one’s belief is false or trust in someone has been misplaced

<b>PHYSICAL SIGNALS AND BEHAVIORS</b> 
Rapid blinking while the rest of the face goes slack
Cocking the head and displaying a ﬁxed look as one wrestles with a sudden discovery
Posture that stiffens, then droops
Stumbling slightly as realization kicks in
Laying a hand against one’s chest, then pulling the front of one’s shirt into a ﬁst
Stuttering; trying to form sentences but failing
Breaths coming faster and deeper, with the chest visibly rising and falling
Looking at the source, then away, and then back in utter disbelief
Holding one’s head in one’s hands 
Uttering <i>No, or It can’t be.</i>
Arms wrapping around oneself in a self-soothing manner 
The eyes widening while one’s head moves forward 
Being open-mouthed and incapable of speech
Citing evidence that supports old beliefs: <i>But you promised you’d quit!</i>
Putting one’s hand up in a warding off gesture 
Rapid breathing while glancing upward
A mouth that trembles
A visible shudder that goes through the entire body
Pinching one’s lips with tented hands while shaking the head 
Stepping back to increase one’s personal space
Clutching at a totem that symbolizes one’s belief (a cross, a gift from the subject, etc.)
Backing up and stumbling because one is not attentive to one’s surroundings
Recoiling from those who offer comfort
Doubting the messenger: <i>You must be wrong. He’d never do that.</i>
Voicing shock
Openly staring at the subject with a pained look that contains hurt and anger
Weaving one’s hands into the hair and pulling slightly to try and anchor one’s emotions
Color bleeding from one’s face (shock) or suddenly ﬂushing (anger)
Offering excuses to cling to previously held beliefs: <i>But they forced you, right?</i>
Leaning forward to catch signs of guilt (when one is with the individual involved)
Staggering away from the person or thing representing one’s disillusionment
Shaking the head and cutting the person off so one can process the information

<b>INTERNAL SENSATIONS</b> 
Feeling cold all over
An unsettling heaviness or ache in the chest 
The stomach hardening
Ribs tightening
A shudder that shakes one’s core

<b>MENTAL RESPONSES</b> 
The mind ﬂashing to events or moments that ﬁrst made one believe 
Experiencing epiphanies in the form of signs one didn’t pick up on at the time
The mind racing for explanations due to an extreme desire to disbelieve the evidence
Thoughts jumping from memory to memory as one wonders if the accusations could be true
Feeling so disoriented one begins to question related beliefs

Sarcasm and the need to hurt with words
Spilling secrets to cause the subject pain
Yelling, pointing ﬁngers, moving aggressively, and other signs of anger taking over
Lashing out with violence (running at someone, trying to hurt them, etc.)
Running away out of an inability to cope (ﬂight)
Becoming embittered toward the person, organization, or idea one was once loyal to
