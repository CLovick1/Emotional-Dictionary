    <pre><b>DEFINITION</b> Losing all hope; becoming despondent

<b>PHYSICAL SIGNALS AND BEHAVIORS</b> 
Shoulders dragging low, the arms losing all tension 
A caved-in chest
A slack expression 
A hanging head
Letting out a hard sigh and closing one’s eyes 
Eyebrows that pinch together
A pained expression
The mouth opening but no words coming forth

Sagging back in one’s seat, hands falling to one’s sides 
Tipping one’s head back to look heavenward, then letting it ﬂop forward
Hair that hangs in one’s face
Stumbling—one’s feet dragging and catching with each step 
Reddening eyes
Making no attempt to wipe loose tears away 
Placing one’s hands over the face
Kneading one’s chest with the heel of one’s hand as if to stop the pain

Lips that pinch together or grimace
Laying one’s head down on the arms (at a table)
Weakly slinging an arm around someone in comfort 
A body that appears to shrink
Retreating inside oneself (not responding to people’s questions or
reacting to touch)
Saying things without a ﬁlter and not caring who is listening: <i>We’re all doomed.</i>
